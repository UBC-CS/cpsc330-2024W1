How does it predict the label for a message it has not seen before?\n\nWhat if the model mis-labels an unseen example? For instance, what if the model incorrectly predicts a non-spam as a spam? What would be the consequences?\nHow do we measure the success or failure of spam identification?\nIf you want to use this model in the wild, how do you know how reliable it is?\n\nWould it be useful to know how confident the model is about the predictions rather than just a yes or a no?\n\nIt’s great to think about these questions right now.
